# IA626_ParkingViolation

###Question

####In this project we will analyze a dataset which contains information about taxi rides in NYC.  The data set is quite large so getting a basic idea of what the data contains is important.  Each student should use one of the CSV files.  Answer the following questions:

+ What time range does your data cover?  How many rows are there total?
+ What are the field names?  Give descriptions for each field.
+ Give some sample data for each field.
+ What MySQL data types would you need to store each of the fields?
+ int(xx), varchar(xx),date, datetime, bool, decimal(m, d)
+ What is the geographic range of your data (min/max - X/Y)?
+ Plot this (approximately on a map)
+ What are the distinct values for each field? (If applicable)
+ For other numeric types besides lat and lon, what are the min and max values?
+ Create a chart which shows the average number of passengers each hour of the day.
+ Create a new CSV file which has only one out of every thousand rows.
+ Repeat step 8 with the reduced dataset and compare the two charts.
